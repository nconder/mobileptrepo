# mobileptrepo
Repository of various scripts related to Mobile PT. Copyrights and Licensing terms belong to respective owners. 

Some scripts are modified based on specific needs.  Use them at your own risk.

The main purpose of creating this repo is to consolidate all scattered scripts into one repo.

It's easy to git clone main tools like drozer/objection with ease but not like small little scripts. 

One method is to use bash script to all scripts but what if such git repo was deleted by author for some reasons.
